# UI Mockups

This folder contains 5 static SVG mockups aligned with the UI/UX Guidelines and PRD.

Files
- 01-main.svg: Main window with tab bar, terminal (top), file pane (bottom), splitter, toast for host/cwd switch.
- 02-ssh-disconnected.svg: Terminal with disconnected banner "Press Enter to reconnect" (dark theme).
- 03-transfers-drawer.svg: Transfers side drawer showing running/paused/failed items.
- 04-knownhost-dialog.svg: Trust host fingerprint confirmation modal.
- 05-settings.svg: Settings view (Connections section) with key options.

Notes
- SVGs are vector and editable; colors roughly follow the token palette defined in docs/ui-ux-guidelines.md.
- Text and geometry are illustrative; final spacing and iconography to be refined during implementation.
