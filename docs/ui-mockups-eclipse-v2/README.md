# Eclipse Workbench — Refined Mockups

Closer adherence to the provided Eclipse screenshot (Clean Sheet light): menubar, toolbar with icons and Quick Access, editor-like tabs for Terminal, view title bars, sash, and status bar.

Files
- 01-main-eclipse-ref.svg — Main window layout (light), matching Eclipse density and tokens
- 02-disconnected-banner.svg — Disconnected banner styling within Terminal view
- 03-context-menu.svg — File pane context menu with hover state

Notes
- Colors and spacing derived from Eclipse 2020-era defaults.
- No scope change: this is purely a visual/interaction treatment over our existing features.
